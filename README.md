# LaTeX-template-OIST-presentation
LaTeX Template for the OIST Presentation Slides

All instructions are specified within the templates themselves. Contact Jeremie (jeremie.gillet@oist.jp) for any question related to the templates.

If you would like to make a change, PRs are welcome.

Light mode and dark mode are available.

Note that those presentations mimic a previous version of the official OIST presentation templates, not the current ones.
